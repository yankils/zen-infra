# Assignment: Cloud Infrastructure Provisioning with Terraform & GitHub Actions

## Overview

In this assignment you will provision a production-grade cloud infrastructure on AWS using Terraform and automate it end-to-end with a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline. The reference implementation is the **zen-infra** repository — your solution should arrive at an architecture equivalent to what is already built here.

By the end of this assignment you will have:

- A multi-environment AWS infrastructure (Dev, QA, Prod) managed entirely by Terraform
- Reusable Terraform modules shared across all environments
- Remote state stored securely in S3 with locking
- A GitHub Actions pipeline that plans, applies, and destroys infrastructure with proper gate controls
- Keyless AWS authentication using GitHub OIDC — no static credentials stored anywhere
- Automated dependency management via Dependabot

### What You Will Build

```
AWS Account
└── us-east-1
    ├── VPC
    │   ├── Public Subnets        — NAT Gateway, Load Balancers
    │   ├── Private EKS Subnets   — EKS worker nodes
    │   └── Private RDS Subnets   — RDS PostgreSQL
    │
    ├── EKS Cluster
    │   └── Managed Node Group
    │
    ├── RDS PostgreSQL
    │   └── Private subnet, encrypted, accessible only from EKS
    │
    ├── ECR Repositories          — one per application service
    │
    ├── IAM
    │   ├── EKS cluster role
    │   ├── EKS node group role
    │   └── GitHub Actions OIDC role (no static credentials)
    │
    └── Secrets Manager
        ├── DB credentials
        └── Application secrets (e.g. JWT secret)
```

### CI/CD Flow

```
Feature branch
    │
    ▼
Pull Request → terraform fmt + validate + plan  (runs automatically)
    │
    ▼
Merge to main → plan → Approval gate → apply
    │
    ▼
Infrastructure updated in AWS
```

## Requirements 

### Section 1 — Repository & Git Workflow (15 points)

| # | Requirement | Points |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Protected main branch** — Require PR review before merging; disallow direct pushes to `main` | 5 |
| 2 | **All changes via Pull Request** — Work on a feature branch, open a PR targeting `main`; no direct commits to `main` | 5 |
| 3 | **No commits from non-default branches** — Enforce branch protection rules in GitHub repository settings | 5 |

---

### Section 2 — Terraform Code Structure (25 points)

| # | Requirement | Points |
|---|---|---|
| 4 | **Three separate environments — Dev, QA, Prod** — Each environment under `envs/<env>/` with its own `backend.tf`, `providers.tf`, `main.tf`, `variables.tf`; environment-specific values set per env | 5 |
| 5 | **Reusable Terraform modules** — All infrastructure logic lives in `modules/`; environments call the same modules with different inputs; each module has `variables.tf` and `outputs.tf` | 10 |
| 6 | **Remote state with S3 backend and locking** — Each environment has its own state file key (e.g. `envs/dev/terraform.tfstate`); encryption enabled; state locking enabled (S3 native locking requires Terraform ≥ 1.10, no DynamoDB needed) | 5 |
| 7 | **Consistent resource tagging** — Every AWS resource tagged with at minimum `Name`, `Env`, and `Project`; tags derived from module input variables, not hardcoded | 5 |

---

### Section 3 — AWS Infrastructure (25 points)

| # | Requirement | Points |
|---|---|---|
| 8 | **VPC with public and private subnets** — Public subnets for NAT Gateway and Load Balancers; private EKS subnets for worker nodes; private RDS subnets for database; Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway, and route tables wired correctly | 5 |
| 9 | **EKS cluster with managed node group** — Cluster with configurable Kubernetes version; node group with min/desired/max scaling; OIDC provider created for IRSA support | 5 |
| 10 | **RDS PostgreSQL in private subnet** — Accessible only from EKS security group; encryption at rest enabled; deployed in private RDS subnets only | 5 |
| 11 | **ECR repositories** — One repository per application service | 3 |
| 12 | **IAM roles with least-privilege policies** — Separate IAM roles for EKS cluster and node group; only required managed policies attached | 4 |
| 13 | **AWS Secrets Manager** — DB credentials and application secrets stored in Secrets Manager; no secrets hardcoded in `.tf` files or committed to git | 3 |

---

### Section 4 — Security & Authentication (15 points)

| # | Requirement | Points |
|---|---|---|
| 14 | **GitHub Actions OIDC — no static AWS credentials** — IAM OIDC identity provider registered for `token.actions.githubusercontent.com`; GitHub Actions assumes an IAM role at runtime; no `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` or `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` stored in GitHub Secrets | 10 |
| 15 | **OIDC trust restricted to specific repos and branches** — Trust policy condition limits which GitHub repositories and branches can assume the role (e.g. only `main` and `develop` of named repos) | 5 |

---

### Section 5 — GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline (20 points)

| # | Requirement | Points |
|---|---|---|
| 16 | **Terraform format and validate on every run** — `terraform fmt -check -recursive` enforces formatting; `terraform validate` catches config errors before plan | 3 |
| 17 | **Terraform Plan runs automatically on every Pull Request** — Pipeline triggers on `pull_request` targeting `main`; plan output visible in pipeline logs | 3 |
| 18 | **Save plan artifact and reuse for apply** — `tfplan` binary uploaded as a pipeline artifact after plan; apply job downloads and applies the exact saved plan — does not re-run plan | 4 |
| 19 | **Manual approval gate before Terraform Apply** — Apply only runs on push/merge to `main`; uses a GitHub Environment with required reviewers; pipeline pauses until a reviewer approves | 4 |
| 20 | **Manual approval gate before Terraform Destroy** — Destroy only via `workflow_dispatch`; requires a typed confirmation input (user must type `"destroy"`); also uses an environment approval gate | 3 |
| 21 | **Prevent concurrent Terraform runs** — Pipeline concurrency group scoped per branch (`terraform-${{ github.ref }}`); `cancel-in-progress: false` so runs wait rather than cancel (prevents state corruption) | 3 |

---

### Section 6 — Operational Maturity (Bonus — 10 points)

| # | Requirement | Points |
|---|---|---|
| 22 | **Path-based pipeline triggers** — Pipeline only triggers when files under `envs/**` or `modules/**` change; README or docs changes do not trigger a run | 3 |
| 23 | **Manual workflow dispatch support** — `workflow_dispatch` input allows triggering plan, apply, or destroy manually from the GitHub Actions UI; destroy requires both action selection and typed confirmation | 3 |
| 24 | **Automated provider version updates via Dependabot** — `dependabot.yml` configured for the `terraform` package ecosystem; weekly update checks for each environment directory; Dependabot opens PRs automatically for new provider versions | 4 |

---

| Section | Points |
|---|---|
| Section 1 — Repository & Git Workflow | 15 |
| Section 2 — Terraform Code Structure | 25 |
| Section 3 — AWS Infrastructure | 25 |
| Section 4 — Security & Authentication | 15 |

- [ ] `terraform validate` passes for each environment
- [ ] GitHub Actions pipeline runs `plan` automatically on every PR to `main`
- [ ] Apply requires a merged PR + environment approval gate
- [ ] Destroy requires `workflow_dispatch` with typed confirmation + environment approval gate

- [ ] No secrets or passwords committed to the repository
- [ ] All AWS resources are tagged with `Name`, `Env`, and `Project`

## Notes

- You are expected to fork this repository and implement the infrastructure in your own AWS account.
- Refer to the `README.md` in this repository for step-by-step setup instructions including AWS account setup, S3 backend creation, GitHub Secrets configuration, and GitHub Environment setup.
- Use Terraform version **1.10.0 or higher** (required for S3 native state locking).
- All costs incurred on your AWS account are your responsibility. Destroy the infrastructure when not in use.
